    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Proscene v2.0.0</strong> is out. Being a stable release, it should now be possible to import it directly from your PDE. Otherwise download it <a href="https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/download/v-2.0.0/proscene-2.0.0.zip">here</a> 
and extract it to your sketchbook <code>libraries</code> folder.</p>

<p>The library aims at providing interactivity to <a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/remixlab/dandelion/core/Frame.html">Frames</a>
(coordinate systems) allowing picking and motion control of objects, including the
<a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/remixlab/dandelion/core/Eye.html">Eye</a>, which in 3D is referred to as the
<a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/remixlab/dandelion/core/Camera.html">Camera</a>.
Version 2 introduces a new library design supporting all the features found in version 1 plus some others.
Perhaps the three key new features are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cross-platform support: the new library architecture separates the core functionalities from the language/platform where target
applications are to be run. <strong>ProScene</strong> may be regarded just as an interface between that core and <strong>Processing</strong>.
Details may be found <a href="http://nakednous.github.io/projects/proscene/">here</a>. The <code>Demos.MatrixShader</code> example shows a taste of it.</li>
  <li>Support to all sorts of interaction mechanisms, including the standard mouse and keyboard, but not being particularly tie
to any of them. i.e., it’s <em>device agnostic</em> by design. The examples of the <code>Input</code> section illustrate the approach.</li>
  <li>Support for 2D as well as 3D Processing renderers. Many of the examples are available in both cases.</li>
</ol>

<p>Combined, features 1. and 2., represent the foundation to implement a wide range of setups ranging from simple to very complex ones.
For instance, we already began a <strong>ProScene</strong> Android port, which is currently taken place at its own
<a href="https://github.com/remixlab/proscene.droid">fork</a>. We hope to integrate it back upstream once <em>TouchEvents</em> are directly
supported in <strong>Processing</strong>. We also plan a first release of the Android port soon, so please stay tuned. In the mean time, have a look
at the <code>examples.Demos.Android2DOF</code>,<code>examples.Demos.Android3DOF</code> which only require the Android-mode of <strong>Processing</strong> to run. We also
implemented a <strong>kinect</strong> interface to control the camera on top of that foundation. The demo may be found at <code>examples.Demos.Kinect5DOF</code>
and the gestures implemented to control the camera <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8SEzFMmMyI">here</a>. Finally, we hope that the
Version 2 cycle will see the first <strong>Java-Script</strong> port taking the most out of our approach.</p>

<p>This release also includes additional examples illustrating most of the new features. We are confident that a <em>learn-by-example</em> methodology
is the main (and most entertained) way to get use to them. The <a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/">API</a> has also been thoroughly reviewed
and fully documented.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

and extract it to your sketchbook <code>libraries</code> folder (automatic importing <em>Proscene</em> from your PDE is only available for stable releases, currently v-1.2.0).</p>

<p>The new API has been thoroughly reviewed and documented and may be considered frozen (unless something unexpected requiring a fix happens).
Check it out <a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/">here</a>. We are greatful to <a href="http://www.alcys.com/">Jacques Maire</a> for contributing the new Proscene logo
code which is a <a href="http://www.mathcurve.com/courbes3d/solenoidtoric/solenoidtoric.shtml">torus solenoid</a>.</p>

<p>The new library architecture comprises the following packages:</p>

<h2 id="fpstiminghttpsgithubcomremixlabfpstimingtree"><a href="https://github.com/remixlab/fpstiming_tree">FPSTiming</a></h2>

<p>A single-threaded <a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/remixlab/fpstiming/TimingHandler.html">timing handler</a> providing timers and animators.
The package may be run stand-alone and it’s provided in its <a href="https://github.com/remixlab/fpstiming_tree">own tree</a>.</p>

<h2 id="biashttpsgithubcomremixlabbiastree"><a href="https://github.com/remixlab/bias_tree">BIAS</a></h2>

<p>An <a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/remixlab/bias/core/InputHandler.html">input handler</a> providing means to translate event input data into high-level
user-defined actions. The package represents the new Proscene event back-end, but it may be run stand-alone and it’s provided in its
<a href="https://github.com/remixlab/bias_tree">own tree</a> too.</p>

<h2 id="dandelionhttpsgithubcomremixlabdandeliontree"><a href="https://github.com/remixlab/dandelion_tree">Dandelion</a></h2>

<p>Package implementing all sorts of (motion) <a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/remixlab/dandelion/core/Constants.DandelionAction.html">actions</a> on Frames
(coordinate systems). Dandelion depends on both, FPSTiming and BIAS. <!--- next version should mention it is language agnostic and the JS approach... --></p>

<h2 id="proscene">Proscene</h2>

<p>Package holding a single class (the <a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/remixlab/proscene/Scene.html">Scene</a>) which represents an interface between Dandelion
and Processing.</p>

<p>Although the (high-level) <a href="http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/remixlab/proscene/Scene.html">Scene API</a> has been re-factored, Proscene1.x users may stick to it
and feel at home. Most of the examples ported from Proscene1.x look even simpler now. They all have been re-organized reflecting the new structure to
attract those willing to digg into the inners of the new architecture.</p>

<p>Expect for one or two more betas before the final release. We plan to improve the docs, particularly that of the examples. Please report any bug or issue you
may find and help us make the upcoming proscene2 as polished as possible.</p>

and extract it to your sketchbook <code>libraries</code> folder (automatic importing <em>proscene</em> from your PDE is only available for stable releases, currently v-1.2.0).</p>

<p>This release completes the main functionality expected in proscene2 and also focuses on API stabilization. Thanks to collaborations with
experimental computational designer <a href="https://twitter.com/AmnonOwed/media">Amnon Owed</a>, to whom we’re greatful, we’ve polished the
KeyFrameInterpolator sub-system. We’ve also implemented view frustum 2D culling routines
(please refer to the new example: <code>TwoD.WindowCulling</code>), thus completing the 2D functionality.</p>

<p>We now enter the beta (sub)cycle which will focus on documentation completeness and bug fixing, to make the upcoming proscene2 as

<p>Respect to the <a href="http://nakednous.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/proscene-v2-dot-0-0-alpha1-released/">first alpha</a>, this release implements full matrix handling in core,
making possible to perform all geometry transformations directly by proscene2. Actually, this is part of a more general idea: to make it
possible to run proscene2 within other contexts different than Processing. Please refer to the new example Basics.MatrixShader.
I hope to give more details here soon.</p>

<p>Currently, we are performing more experiments to decide what experimental stuff will make it into the upcoming cycle. We plan to release a pair or
so of more alphas with our results before entering beta stage.</p>

    <id>http://nakednous.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/proscene-v2-dot-0-0-alpha1-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I’m releasing the first alpha of what will hopefully become <em>proscene2</em>. For the impatient, <a href="https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/download/v-2.0.0-alpha.1/proscene-2.0.0-alpha.1.zip">download it</a> and extract it to your sketchbook <code>libraries</code> folder (automatic importing <em>proscene</em> from your PDE is only available for stable releases, currently v-1.2.0). Even though the library has almost been completely rewritten from the ground up, you will find most of the current examples with some minor changes, plus a whole bunch of new ones. There’s also a new project <a href="http://otrolado.info/">home</a> and its code is now kindly hosted at <a href="https://github.com/remixlab">github</a>. Read on for some more details.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Some years ago <em>Proscene</em> was firstly designed to ease interactivity of 3D <em>Processing</em> scenes through standard input devices: mouse and keyboard. Then at some point when we noticed that some of you guys were interacting within your sketches using “non-standard” Human Interface Devices (HIDs), we decided to add some basic support to them, but the code never really makes it to <em>Proscene’s</em> core: the <code>iFrame</code> class hierarchy. The reason for that being that <code>iFrames</code> and (standard) input events were tightly coupled. Our first <em>Proscene</em> design also lacked providing means to interact using a touch device, mainly because back in 2010 when it was first released, there wasn’t a Processing “android mode”. On the other hand, as with any other <em>Processing</em> library, publishing a sketch online was a matter of exporting it as a java applet. However, this is no longer the case and, as most of you probably know, Java-Script (JS) has almost ended up replacing java applets in <em>Processing2</em>.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-for-the-proscene2-cycle">Challenges for the Proscene2 cycle</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Add 2D <code>Scene</code> mode (e.g., <code>size(640, 360, P2D); scene = new Scene(this);</code>). Yes, it’s not part of the above motivation, but that would be cool ;)</li>
  <li>Allow adding a new HID to interact with a 2D or 3D scene as simple as possible, without hindering the customization flexibility as it is found with standard devices.</li>
  <li>Support other <em>Processing</em> modes such as JS and/or Android.</li>
</ol>

<p>and while it has been progress for the third challenge, this release only covers the first two of them.</p>

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<ol>
  <li>2D interactivity required <code>scaling</code> to be added to <code>iFrames</code> which are now defined by their <code>position</code>, <code>orientation</code> and (now) <code>scaling</code>. As a result, moving the viewpoint around, picking and manipulating objects, adding keyframes to a camera path, etc., are all now possible in 2D too.</li>
  <li>We completely decoupled the handling of HIDs from the set of <em>actions</em> (all sorts of <code>iFrame</code> manipulations) supported by <em>Proscene</em>, by defining a set of <em>virtual events</em> (called <code>TerseEvents</code>) which represents an interface between them. An important <code>TerseEvent</code> specialization is a <code>MotionEvent</code> which is defined according to its degrees-of-freedom (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(mechanics)">DOFs</a>), making it particularly suitable to applications requiring all sorts of kinematics computations, such as those involved in <code>iFrame</code> manipulations. Adding an HID thus “<em>only</em>” requires reducing hardware input events to <code>MotionEvents</code>, from which all <em>Proscene</em> actions are now implemented.</li>
</ol>

<p>Expect more technical details regarding <em>Proscene2</em> and its new package structure with the next pre-releases.</p>

<h2 id="current-status-why-we-call-it-alpha1">Current status: why we call it <em>alpha.1</em>?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>JS mode: work-in-progress.</li>
  <li>Examples documentation: mostly missing. However all the examples seem to run fine here (<a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">archlinux</a> and <em>Processing-2.1b1</em>).</li>
  <li>API docs: broken and incomplete.</li>
  <li>Advanced examples need more polishing.</li>
</ol>

<p>This release is mainly aimed at testers and enthusiasts that wanna try the new features from perfectly well undocumented examples ;)</p>
