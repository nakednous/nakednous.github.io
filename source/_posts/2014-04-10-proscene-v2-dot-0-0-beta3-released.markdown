Proscene v2.0.0-beta3 is out. Download it [here](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/download/v-2.0.0-beta.3/proscene-2.0.0-beta.3.zip) 
and extract it to your sketchbook `libraries` folder (automatic importing *Proscene* from your PDE is only available for stable releases, currently v-1.2.0).

This release introduces the first *proscene* Android port thanks to [Victor Forero](https://sites.google.com/site/proscenedroi/home) and also improves
the [API docs](http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/). The port is taken place at its own [fork](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene.droid) which
we hope to integrate it back upstream once it is ready. The related zip file may be found
[here](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene.droid/blob/master/distribution/proscene-16/download/proscene.zip). Here's a proof-of-concept example
illustrating how to control the Scene using [DOF2Events](http://otrolado.info/prosceneApi/remixlab/bias/event/DOF2Event.html):
