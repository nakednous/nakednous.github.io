**Proscene v2.0.2** is out. It should be possible to import it directly from your PDE. Otherwise download it [here](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/download/v-2.0.2/proscene-2.0.2.zip) 
and extract it to your sketchbook `libraries` folder.

# Changelog

1. Fix for a ZOOM_ON_REGION action bug that appeared when the action was triggered during a mouse drag and wasn't started at a mouse press.
2. New example `Timing.AnimationHandler` which illustrates how to add an animation handler function to the scene.
