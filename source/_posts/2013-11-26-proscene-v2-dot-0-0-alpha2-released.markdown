Proscene v2.0.0-alpha2 is out. Download it [here](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/download/v-2.0.0-alpha.2/proscene-2.0.0-alpha.2.zip) 
and extract it to your sketchbook `libraries` folder (automatic importing *proscene* from your PDE is only available for stable releases, currently v-1.2.0).

Respect to the [first alpha](http://nakednous.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/proscene-v2-dot-0-0-alpha1-released/), this release implements full matrix handling in core,
making possible to perform all geometry transformations directly by proscene2. Actually, this is part of a more general idea: to make it
possible to run proscene2 within other contexts different than Processing. Please refer to the new example Basics.MatrixShader.
I hope to give more details here soon.

Currently, we are performing more experiments to decide what experimental stuff will make it into the upcoming cycle. We plan to release a pair or
so of more alphas with our results before entering beta stage.
