**Proscene v2.0.4** is out. It should be possible to import/update it directly from your PDE. Otherwise download it [here](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/download/v-2.0.4/proscene-2.0.4.zip) 
and extract it to your sketchbook `libraries` folder.

# Changelog

+ Adds few `remixlab.bias.agent.profile` API improvements missed in the [previous release](http://nakednous.github.io/blog/2014/07/25/proscene-v2-dot-0-3-released/). Methods holding the old syntax have been marked as deprecated
