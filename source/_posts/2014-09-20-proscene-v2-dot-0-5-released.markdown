**Proscene v2.0.5** is out. It should be possible to import/update it directly from your PDE. Otherwise download it [here](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/download/v-2.0.5/proscene-2.0.5.zip) 
and extract it to your sketchbook `libraries` folder.

# Changelog

+ Most of the examples have been simplified to better follow **Processing** style and conventions.
+ Fixes a bug in the _KeyFrameInterpolator_ when restoring a position within a path having a single keyframe.
+ The PointUnderPixel example is back, thanks to the discussion that's going [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/2771).
