Proscene v2.0.0-alpha3 is out. Download it [here](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/download/v-2.0.0-alpha.3/proscene-2.0.0-alpha.3.zip) 
and extract it to your sketchbook `libraries` folder (automatic importing *proscene* from your PDE is only available for stable releases, currently v-1.2.0).

This release completes the main functionality expected in proscene2 and also focuses on API stabilization. Thanks to collaborations with
experimental computational designer [Amnon Owed](https://twitter.com/AmnonOwed/media), to whom we're greatful, we've polished the
KeyFrameInterpolator sub-system. We've also implemented view frustum 2D culling routines
(please refer to the new example: `TwoD.WindowCulling`), thus completing the 2D functionality.

We now enter the beta (sub)cycle which will focus on documentation completeness and bug fixing, to make the upcoming proscene2 as
polished as possible.
