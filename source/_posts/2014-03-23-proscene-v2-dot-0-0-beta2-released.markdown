Proscene v2.0.0-beta2 is out. Download it [here](https://github.com/remixlab/proscene/releases/download/v-2.0.0-beta.2/proscene-2.0.0-beta.2.zip) 
and extract it to your sketchbook `libraries` folder (automatic importing *Proscene* from your PDE is only available for stable releases, currently v-1.2.0).

This release fixes a nasty bug introduced in the [previous beta](http://nakednous.github.io/blog/2014/03/22/proscene-v2-dot-0-0-beta1-released/) which made
the scene dissapear when dragging with the mouse center button. Thanks to [Amnon Owed](https://twitter.com/AmnonOwed/media) for reporting it.
We encourage all Proscene2 users to upgrade to this version.
